While our jobs were rewarding, we just didn’t have enough time for our 5 kids and knew we needed to make a change.  What we liked about this business is that we could build something that didn’t require us to constantly trade our time for money.  Because of this business, Katie has now been able to retire from nursing and <span class="font-weight-bold">we’re building our dreams instead of someone else’s.</span></p>

I had lost confidence in myself, but when I found this business, I met people who believed in me for than I believed in myself.  What really appealed to me the most was that there were successful people that were willing to teach me exactly what to do to have success and I just had to follow their lead.

We were maxed out on credit cards and felt like we were at the end of our rope.  As painful as it was, I’m grateful for that experience, because it made me humble and teachable and willing to listen to other people’s ideas that had what I was looking for.  After 18 months of working hard in this business, we were fortunate enough to completely pay off all of our debt. <span class="font-weight-bold">Now, we’re traveling the world, earning a 7-figure residual income, and have more happiness and purpose than we’ve ever had in our entire lives.</span></p>

                I spent eleven years in home improvement sales before starting with Symmetry part-time in 2015. While I was earning good money, I spent long hours on the road. With two young daughters I wanted to be sure I didn’t miss them growing up. The Symmetry system has been instrumental in balancing a career and family. My wife Kelly has been a huge contributor in the growth of my agency, as she has worked by myside. I enjoy playing tennis with my girls vacationing, playing guitar and living out one of the companies core values, “Have fun and get stuff done.”</div>

My time and conversations are not being micromanaged. I like the idea of commission because I determine my paycheck, not someone else. This is a relationship we’re  building with our clients and we want them to feel comfortable with us.” <span class="font-weight-bold">- Michelle Roberts, Symmetry Agent in South Carolina </span>
